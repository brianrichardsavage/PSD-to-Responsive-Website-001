          <p>(Marty hits 88 MPH and is transported back to 1885.) (1885) (As Marty looks ahead he sees that the fake Indians from the screen have turned into full fledged Indians and they are heading straight towards him.) INDIANS! (An Indian drumbeat begins to play.)</p>

          <p>(w.t) Doc, come in Doc, this is Marty, over. (v.o) Roger Marty, this is Doc. Are you there? (Marty looks through the binoculars. He's looking at a house, filled with garden ornaments and a sign - No Trespassers - Violators Will Be Prosecuted. This Means You!) (w.t) Yeah Doc, I'm at the address. (looks at the front door) It's the only Tannen in the book...but I don't think it's Biff's house. It looks like some old lady lives here. (Then to prove Marty wrong, Biff leaves the house. But to prove Marty right as well, the voice of Grandma Tannen can be heard. The following is viewed through the binoculars.)</p>

          <p>Marty, that was very interesting music. Uh, yeah. I hope you don't mind but George asked if he could take me home. Great good, good, Loraine, I had a feeling about you two. I have a feeling too.</p>

          <p>I just wanna use the phone. Yeah, it's in the back. (goes and looks through the white pages in the phone book) Brown, Brown, Brown, Brown, Brown, great, you're alive. (He tries calling but there's no answer. So he goes over to the bar.) Do you know where 1640 Riversideâ€¦ Are you gonna order something, kid? Yeah, gimme a Tab.</p>

          <p class="tags">Nusiness Card, Graphic</p>
          <p>It's a Derringer, Smithy. Small but effective. Last time I used it the fella took two days to die. Bled to death inside, it was real painful. (the gang laughs) That means you'd be dead by about suppertime Monday. I don't know who you think you are, but we're dancing. Well looky what we have here...introduce me to the lady; I'd like a dance. (Doc turns around to face Tannen with a brave and determined look on his face. Now Tannen moves the gun barrel to his throat.) I wouldn't give you the pleasure; you'll just have to go ahead and shoot.</p>

          <p class="tags">Nusiness Card, Graphic</p>
          <p>(Marty and Doc walk up to the school.) Whoa, they really cleaned this place up, looks brand new. Now remember, according to my theory you interfered with your parent's first meeting. They don't meet, they don't fall in love, they won't get married and they wont have kids. That's why your older brother's disappeared from that photograph. Your sister will follow and unless you repair the damages, you will be next. This sounds pretty heavy. Weight has nothing to do with it.</p>

          <p>(on video) Third time's the charm. (Biff kisses Lorraine. Marty can't believe it.) No!!! (He steps backwards - into the arms of 3-D, Match and Skinhead. Skinhead grabs Marty.) No! Hey wait, you're coming with us upstairs! Let me go!</p>

      It's not gonna happen Doc. (Doc looks at him.) After you fix the time circuits and put new tires on the Delorean, I'm going back to 1885 and I'm bringing you home. (Drive-In - Day) (Marty is in the bathroom changing into western style clothing while Doc is outside putting last minute touches on the Delorean.) The clothes fit? (os) Yeah! Everything except the boots, Doc. They're kind of tight! I dunno, are you sure this stuff is authentic?
